# Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
A mini project for AI subject at school.
The project aims to show how they are applied in the first semester
past knowledge when solving machine learning problems. Choosing Pima
Indians Diabetes data system I started working on it according to specific steps
sequence. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.We will look at the detailed presentation of Dataset later.
The goal is to learn from the available data, so the model should be able to correctly
predict whether the person (in this case only 21 and above will perform
aged women) is sick with diabetes. We will study and describe
dataset features and labels. Let's get acquainted with the models
I worked with, and also the work process will be presented. In the models section
model estimation and hyperparameter selection will also be presented.
However, before presenting the main work, let's equip ourselves with preliminary knowledge
about diabetes and let's understand what it is.\
You can also see **Documentation** as pdf file, where I describe everything about models and codes on armenian.

### Our features are
* Pregnancies
* Glucose(mg/dL),
* BloodPressure 
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age

Labels represented as 0(doesn't gave the desease) and 1(has the desease). 
### Classifiers
* K-NN
* Decision Tree
* SVM (Support Vector Machine)

### Evaluation metricies
* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* F1-score

**Decision Tree** was selected as the best classifier based on its accuracy values. \

ðŸŸ The whole code is written in Jupiter Notebook.
